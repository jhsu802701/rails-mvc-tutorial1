# Rails MVC Tutorial 1

## Purpose
The purpose of this tutorial is to introduce the Model/View/Controller architecture by analyzing a very basic app.  This app is the same app described on the [Raspberry Pi Ruby on Rails page](http://elinux.org/RPi_Ruby_on_Rails).

The MVC architecture governs how a Rails app works, and understanding it is crucial to working productively.  Because MVC is the topic in Ruby on Rails that is most difficult to understand, this tutorial and others in this series skip topics like testing and deployment.

## Prerequisites
* You should have completed at least the first two chapters in [Rails Tutorial](https://www.railstutorial.org).
* You should have a Docker container based on my current rbenv-general Docker image.  More details are on the [Ruby on Racetracks](http://www.rubyonracetracks.com) web site.
