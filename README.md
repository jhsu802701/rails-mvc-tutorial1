# Rails MVC Tutorial 1

## Purpose
The purpose of this tutorial is to introduce the Model/View/Controller architecture by analyzing a very basic app.  This app is the same app described on the (Raspberry Pi Ruby on Rails page)[http://elinux.org/RPi_Ruby_on_Rails].

The MVC architecture governs how a Rails app works, and understanding it is crucial to working productively.  Because MVC is the topic in Ruby on Rails that is most difficult to understand, this tutorial and others in this series skip topics like testing and deployment.

## Prerequisites
* You must have Ruby on Rails installed on your local machine.  Bash commands are required.  (If you are a Windows user, you should use a Linux virtual machine through VirtualBox.)
* Use of a Docker container based on the current rbenv-general Docker image is recommended.  More details are on the (Ruby on Racetracks)[http://www.rubyonracetracks.com] web site.
